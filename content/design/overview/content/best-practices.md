## Auto Layout
Setting layout constraints are an important part of the process with Figma. When used in conjunction with spacing tokens and a layout grid, they become a time saver as you iterate or need to communicate scaling.

## Version history

Figma automatically keeps a running file version history. Viewers can browse previous save points; Editors can revert.

### Create save point
In addition to auto-saves, it’s a best practice to manually create versions at clear milestones of a project. 

To create a new version go to `File -> Save to Version History`. 

Versions should include brief documentation:

* Title - that clearly reflects the saved state
* Description - optionally add notes to help clarify what’s changed


## Branching
As Figma describes it, “Branches are exploratory spaces that enable designers to safely try new ideas without making changes to the main, or existing, file. Rather than auto-saving to the main file, changes from branches are merged into the main file when you're ready.”

### Benefits
* Protects the state of the main file
* Tracks and manage evolution of work
* Mitigates change management issues with Engineering and Product partners
* Enables peer review and approvals
* Notifies select members (or slack channels) when new branches are merged into the main file
