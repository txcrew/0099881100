We aim for optimal readability and clear hierarchy on a variety of devices.

## Font families
Venmo digital products use two font families:

### Athletics
A monolinear sans serif designed by OMSE. Extended strokes, asymmetric arcs, and a low aperture come together in a characterful yet functional typeface. Primary uses are for display instances.

### Scto Grotesk A
A self-evident sans created by Schick Toikka, designed to be a no nonsense vessel for communication. Primary uses are within body copy.

## Scale
Our type scale is built using measurements in “rem” with a base font size of 16px. This allows design and development to keep a consistent hierarchy when scaled up or down, across devices.

| Name      | REM      | PX     |
| --------  | -------- | ------ |
| Small     | 0.875    | 14     |
| **Base** | **1**    | **16**  |
| large     | 1.125    | 18     |
| display10  | 1.25    | 20     |
| display20  | 1.5    | 24     |
| display30  | 2.25   | 36     |
| display40  | 2.75    | 44     |
| display50  | 3.25    | 52     |

The base font size is the reference for all other sizes in the scale. 
Example: The display30 font size token is determend base * 2.25 = 36px (where base=16).
