Variables for visual consistency across platforms.

## What is a design token?
Design tokens are named entities that store visual design attributes. 

Rather than hardcoding values for colors, typography, spacing, and several other properties can be stored in a token and distributed and translated into specific programming languages.

A detailed breakdown on tokens can be found in the [W3C draft proposal](https://second-editors-draft.tr.designtokens.org/).

(include mermaid diagram)

Although decision decisions can be made using Figma, the applicaiton itself like other languages and platforms, is a consumer of tokens.
