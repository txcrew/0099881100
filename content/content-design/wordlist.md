The word list isn’t a glossary or a dictionary. It contains usage guidelines for terms specific to Intuit products. We follow AP style and Merriam Webster in most cases. If our usage differs (like our preference for the serial comma, for example), we make note of it. If you don’t see a word here, check AP Stylebook and the dictionary. You can also use search to see if guidance lives elsewhere on the site.

### a.m. 
Don’t use this. Instead, use AM (no periods, capitalize). See more guidelines for time.

### above, below
Avoid using above or below because directional cues aren’t accessible.

If you need to refer to text in a help article, refer to the exact area (for example, Step 4 and not Step 4 below).

If you need to refer to the UI, just name the element (for example, Go to Customers and not Go to Customers on the left).
